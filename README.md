# Null check in reduce() method in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with lists containing nullable values.  The `reduce()` method is concise but can throw exceptions if not handled properly.

The provided Dart code illustrates the problem and a solution using the `fold()` method, which offers more control and flexibility for handling null values.  This example highlights the importance of careful null checks when working with nullable types and collection functions in Dart.  The solution provides a more robust and error-free approach.
